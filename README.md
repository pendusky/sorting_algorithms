 Weight: 2
 Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: UBONG EFFIONG)
 Ongoing second chance project - started Jan 18, 2023 6:00 AM, must end by Jan 29, 2023 6:00 AM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
In a nutshellâ€¦
Contribution: 100.0%
Auto QA review: 0.0/48 mandatory & 0.0/100 optional
Altogether:  0.0%
Mandatory: 0.0%
Optional: 0.0%
Contribution: 100.0%
Calculation:  100.0% * (0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%) )  == 0.0%



Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.
